# Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn by analyzing behavioral, demographic, and account data. The goal is to build and deploy a machine learning model capable of identifying customers at risk of cancelling their services. The project includes a full end-to-end pipeline: data analysis, preprocessing, model training, testing, deployment via Docker, and a working web app hosted on Google Cloud Platform.

### What is Churn?
Churn refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a service provider. By identifying potential churners in advance, businesses can develop effective customer retention strategies.
