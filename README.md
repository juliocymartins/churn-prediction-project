# Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn by analyzing behavioral, demographic, and account data. The goal is to build and deploy a machine learning model capable of identifying customers at risk of cancelling their services. The project includes a full end-to-end pipeline: data analysis, preprocessing, model training, testing, deployment via Docker, and a working web app hosted on Google Cloud Platform.

### What is Churn?
Churn refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a service provider. By identifying potential churners in advance, businesses can develop effective customer retention strategies.

# About Dataset

### Context
"Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." [IBM Sample Data Sets]

### Content
Each row represents a customer, each column contains customerâ€™s attributes described on the column Metadata.

The data set includes information about:

- Customers who left within the last month â€“ the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for â€“ phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information â€“ how long theyâ€™ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers â€“ gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

# How to Use the App

1. **Adjust the Input Settings**  
   Use the sidebar to fill in customer data, such as **tenure**, **monthly charges**, **internet services**, and **contract type**.

2. **Predict**  
   - Click **Predict** to generate a churn prediction based on the current input values.  
   - The result will indicate whether the customer is likely to **churn** or **stay**, along with the **probability**.

3. **Test with Churn Data**  
   - Click **Test with Churn Data** to auto-fill the form with a real example of a customer who **left**.  
   - The app will automatically run a prediction using this example.

4. **Test with Non-Churn Data**  
   - Click **Test with Non-Churn Data** to auto-fill the form with a real example of a customer who **did not churn**.  
   - The app will show the prediction result accordingly.
